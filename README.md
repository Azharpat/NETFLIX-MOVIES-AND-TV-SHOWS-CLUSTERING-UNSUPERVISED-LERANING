Introduction:
With more than 83 million subscribers and presence in more than 190 countries, Netflix is the most popular Internet television network in the world. Its users watch more than 125 million hours of TV and movie content daily, including original series, documentaries, and feature films. On almost any screen that is linked to the Internet, members can watch as much as they want, whenever and wherever. Without interruptions or obligations, members can play, pause, and resume watching at any time.

Problem Statement
Netflix is the world's largest online streaming service provider, with over 220 million subscribers as of 2022-Q2. It is crucial that they effectively cluster the shows that are hosted on their platform in order to enhance the user experience, thereby preventing subscriber churn.
We will be able to understand the shows that are similar to and different from one another by creating clusters, which may be leveraged to offer the consumers personalized show suggestions depending on their preferences.
The goal of this project is to classify/group the Netflix shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.
Project Summary
Dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third-party Netflix search engine.

In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. It will be interesting to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

In this project, we worked on a text clustering problem where we had to classify/group the Netflix movie/shows into certain clusters such that the shows within a cluster are similar to each other and the shows in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.
